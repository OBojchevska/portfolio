        <div class="overview">
            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Vidi Vaka is a medium intended to inform the digital generation, which usually receives news online.
                Their way of reporting is usually not related to the daily events, nor do they focus on the daily
                political news. On the contrary, they try to focus on the topics that they think are most important to
                the public, as well as the people that they think deserve more attention. That is why their motto is "We
                make stories that are worthwhile". What sets them apart from other video production companies is the
                storytelling, they do not produce videos but tell stories. Their specialty is to find the best way to
                convey the story to the audience in the most effective way. Therefore, it can be said that Vidi Vaka is
                not only a medium, but also a storytelling studio that deals with various topics with which it gives a
                voice to the deaf.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Statement:</h3>
            <p>
                Their vision is to develop storytelling to an even higher level, to introduce new, innovative formats
                both in the production and in the storytelling itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                So <span class="potencirano"> the biggest challenge </span>in redesigning their website was that the new
                page should reflect
                their work,
                ie. the new website should reflect a modern brand, technologically developed, which offers a wide range
                of storytelling formats, and the content it offers is clear, understandable and important to all. Also,
                the new website should dynamically present their work and the different story formats they offer and
                emphasize their quality. So the website need to give us technical possibilities for new formats of
                narrative content like storytelling through data visualization, podcasts, multimedia formats, etc.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="solution">
            <h3>Solutions:</h3>
            <p>
                Our <span class="potencirano"> main goal of this project</span> was for the new web page to be agile, ie
                to suffer easy change of
                segments, rearrangement, etc., in case a new content format is added or we want to remove a format, and
                thus the goal segment of the site. Because storytelling technologies are changing rapidly, it is
                important to be able to implement new things, that is, to add new segments in a simple way. From a
                design point of view, that would probably mean more modularity, less monolithicity.
            </p>

            <p>
                So the first thing we did after a detailed review of the submitted brief, was the interview with the
                stakeholders through which we got a more detailed picture of what they want to be reflected through the
                new website. The next step was competitive analysis, we looked at our competitors, their strengths and
                weaknesses and found out where we could improve.
            </p>
            <p>Based on the research we conducted on the users, we got 2 personas</p>
            <p>Our primary persona is Sara Trpkovska a young, responsible person who constantly follows the events in
                the environment in which she lives and always tries to do everything in her power.</p>

            <img src="Images/VidiVakaSliki/personaone.png" class="vvPersona">

            <p>
                Our secondary person is an older person, a business owner who cares about his employees because he knows
                that
                they are the ones who owe the success of his company.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/VidiVakaSliki/personatwo.png" class="vvPersona">
            <p>Since this project was a redesign of an existing website that already has a well-established and
                recognizable brand identity, we tried to keep it.</p>
            <img src="Images/VidiVakaSliki/deks-light-fin-vv.png" width="900px" height="1400px" id="vvDL">
            <p> Also through the interviews we did with our users we noticed that 70% of users access the website
                through
                their mobile device. That is why we paid great attention to responsiveness.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/VidiVakaSliki/Desktop-vv-mob-light.png" width="900px">

            <p>Many users of their electronic devices use dark mode, so during the redesign of the site we introduced a
                dark mode option which is shown in the following screens.</p>

            <img src="Images/VidiVakaSliki/vv-dark-mobile.png" width="900px">

        <div class="outcome">
            <h3>Outcome:</h3>
            <p>

                Through the work of this project I had the opportunity to go through in detail all the stages of the
                redesign of a website. Also through the meetings we held with our client we managed to get a better
                picture of our solution. But working in a group with 4 more UX / UI designers opened my horizons to
                fresh perspectives and constructive feedback from people that are in the same field as I am.
