            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Brainster is an educational center that organizes courses and academies designed to master the most
                sought after skills today by working on real projects for real clients. Through Brainster, young people
                can start building the careers they desire in some of the highest paid IT professions today, such as
                programming, digital marketing, graphic and UX / UI design, data science and software testing.</p>

        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Statement:</h3>
            <p>
                Brainster's new app should allow users to learn through microlearning. That is, to upgrade or improve
                their knowledge through daily learning of small lessons in one of the areas where Brainster already
                holds longer courses and academies such as programming, digital marketing, graphic and UX / UI design,
                data science and software testing.

            <p>
                <span class="potencirano">The biggest challenge</span> in this project is that through the application
                users can improve their skills or
                gain new ones through very short lessons that will take very little of their time, but at the same time
                will be interesting enough to motivate the user to be consistent to ultimately provide visible
                improvements.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="solution">
            <h3>Solutions:</h3>
            <p>
                Based on the interviews we conducted with our users, we noticed that most of them use applications of
                this type while waiting in line, during breaks, while riding a bus or some similar situations. That is
                why we have divided the lessons into Case Studies, so that users will have access to a new case study
                every day that will not last longer than 15 minutes and so that users can use the application in any
                environment, most case studies are presented through text and image and if there is a video it is
                usually a short animation so that users will be able to follow case studies whether they are in a hurry
                or similar to be able to follow the lessons in any environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                We spent the first week researching competitors. The applications we have reviewed are Duolingo, Udemy,
                ProApp.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><span class="potencirano">User research:</span> The next step was user research and based on the results
                we received from our respondents
                we concluded that most of them use applications of this type to gain new skills or improve their
                knowledge in existing, while a very small number respondents said they use such entertainment
                applications.</p>
            <p>However, only 30% of the respondents answered that they complete all the courses they have started, while
                the rest usually complete only those courses that they need for school work or similar. So based on the
                answers we received from our users we created a person who is a young person because most of the users
                of this type of applications are people from j to j years and through its goals and frustrations we were
                guided in the design of the application with in order for our users to be more consistent in the
                learning process and to complete the courses that have already started.</p>

            <p>
                In order for our users to be more consistent each case study will be available only 24h and if users do
                not pass that case study within 24h it is lost and until the whole lesson with all case studies is
                completed they will not be able to see the missed case study. This will motivate users by triggering
                their "fear of missing out".
            </p>
            <img src="Images/TheLearnAppSliki/learntwo.png" width="900px">
            <p>Also, in order to increase the motivation of the users, we introduced gamification, ie after each
                completed case study, the users will receive points according to which they will be ranked and if they
                are satisfied with their rank, they will be able to share their success on social networks. Also for
                those who complete all case studies will eventually receive a certificate.</p>

            <h3>Outcome:</h3>
            <p>

                While working on this project I had the opportunity to be involved in every step of the design of the
                mobile application, starting from the research itself, the creation of wireframes, the ui design and the
                prototype. Thanks to that I was able to see how much impact each step has on the final result of the
                product. Especially through the conversation with our users we managed to see what bothers them the most
                when using applications of this type and we tried to improve it with our design.
